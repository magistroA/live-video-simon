###Live Video Simon
The project utilizes the YoloV8 and OpenCV libraries to recreate the memory game Simon on a live video feed from a computer webcam. The player will be shown a sequence on the video, and then will be prompted to repeat the sequence by stepping into the correct squares in the correct order. This project represents my final design project for ECE 1895 - Junior Design.
